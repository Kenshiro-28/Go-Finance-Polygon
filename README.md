# Gō Finance

Gō Finance is a 100% decentralized DeFi platform with an open source web interface that anyone can download and run locally on their computer.

Smart contracts have no ownership privileges and run an immutable set of rules. They are deployed on Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.

Keep in mind that trading is a risky activity that can involve a loss of money. You should only invest the amount you can afford to lose.

## Tokenomics

pGō is a fully decentralized token with limited supply and very slow issuance, which makes it a good store of value. The name comes from the gō (合) or cup, which is a traditional Japanese unit used for a serving of rice and a cup of sake in Japanese cuisine.

Token name: pGō

Total supply: 1 million

## Gō farm

You can stake your pGō tokens to earn pGō rewards that are variable and subject to the dynamics of supply and demand. Your rewards increase with your staking power, which depends on how often you harvest your rewards: the longer the time between harvests, the higher the staking power.

You can harvest up to one time per day, but the maximum staking power is reached after one year without harvesting. Keep in mind that your rewards may suddenly increase or decrease depending on how much other users harvest and the total deposits on the farm, so the most conservative approach is frequent harvests.

## Rei pool

You can stake your pGō tokens to earn Dai rewards that are variable and subject to the dynamics of supply and demand. Your rewards increase with your staking power, which depends on how often you harvest your rewards: the longer the time between harvests, the higher the staking power.

You can harvest up to one time per day, but the maximum staking power is reached after one month without harvesting. Keep in mind that your rewards may suddenly increase or decrease depending on how much other users harvest and the total deposits on the farm, so the most conservative approach is frequent harvests.

Deposit fees are used to buy pWings and deposit it in the JetSwap Pool. Two-thirds of the pWings rewards earned on JetSwap are used to buy Dai and deposit it in the rewards fund. The remaining third of the rewards are reinvested in the Pool, increasing performance over time.

## Vault

You can stake your WETH tokens to earn WETH rewards that are variable and subject to the dynamics of supply and demand. Your rewards increase with your staking power, which depends on how often you harvest your rewards: the longer the time between harvests, the higher the staking power.

You can harvest up to one time per day, but the maximum staking power is reached after one month without harvesting. Keep in mind that your rewards may suddenly increase or decrease depending on how much other users harvest and the total deposits on the vault, so the most conservative approach is frequent harvests.

Deposit fees are used to buy pWings and deposit it in the JetSwap Pool. Two-thirds of the pWings rewards earned on JetSwap are used to buy WETH and deposit it in the rewards fund. The remaining third of the rewards are reinvested in the Pool, increasing performance over time.
